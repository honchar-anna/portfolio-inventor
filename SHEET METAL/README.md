# 🏗 Sheet Metal Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains several **Sheet Metal projects** created in Autodesk Inventor. Each model demonstrates the use of **bends, flanges, cutouts, and flat patterns** to design real-world manufacturable parts. These projects helped me develop a deeper understanding of **sheet metal fabrication techniques and unfolding processes**.
