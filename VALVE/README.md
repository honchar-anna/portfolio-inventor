# 🔧 Vent Assembly (12-Part Mechanical Model)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to **work with assemblies** in Autodesk Inventor. The ventil consists of **12 separate parts**, assembled into a fully functional mechanical unit.

## 📂 Features & Skills Demonstrated
✔ **Assembly Design** – Constructing multi-part assemblies with proper constraints  
✔ **Exploded View Animation** – Creating an exploded view to visualize the assembly process  
✔ **Technical Drawings** – Generating 2D drawings for manufacturing  
✔ **Motion Simulation** – Basic movement visualization using Inventor Animation  
✔ **File Management** – Organizing and linking multiple part files in an assembly
