# 🔧 Vent Assembly (12-Part Mechanical Model)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to **work with assemblies** in Autodesk Inventor. The ventil consists of **12 separate parts**, assembled into a fully functional mechanical unit.

## 📂 Features & Skills Demonstrated
✔ **Assembly Design** – Constructing multi-part assemblies with proper constraints  
✔ **Exploded View Animation** – Creating an exploded view to visualize the assembly process  
✔ **Technical Drawings** – Generating 2D drawings for manufacturing  
✔ **Motion Simulation** – Basic movement visualization using Inventor Animation  
✔ **File Management** – Organizing and linking multiple part files in an assembly

## 📂 Files Included
📁 **Vent_Assembly.iam** – Inventor assembly file  
📁 **Part_Files/** – All 12 part files (`.ipt`)  
📁 **Vent_Exploded_View.idw** – Drawing with exploded view  
📁 **Vent_Animation.mp4** – Simple animation showing the assembly process  

## 🛠 How to Use
1. **Download the repository** or use `git clone`:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vent-assembly.git
   ```
2. Open **`Vent_Assembly.iam`** in **Autodesk Inventor**  
3. Explore the assembly, constraints, and exploded views  
4. Check **technical drawings** and **animation** for better visualization
