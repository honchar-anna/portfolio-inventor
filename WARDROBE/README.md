# 🏠 Custom Wardrobe Design (Real-World Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to **design and model a real-world wardrobe system** in Autodesk Inventor. The wardrobe consists of **four separate cabinets**, positioned together to create a seamless storage solution in a dedicated walk-in closet. All measurements were taken manually to ensure a perfect fit for the space. 

## 📂 Features & Skills Demonstrated
✔ **Real-world measurements & modeling** – Designed based on actual room dimensions  
✔ **Modular assembly** – Each cabinet is a separate unit, allowing flexibility  
✔ **Functional Design** – Includes **hanger tubes for clothes** and **open shelves for storage**  
✔ **Technical Drawings** – Generated precise **2D manufacturing drawings**
